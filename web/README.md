This is the frontend web app to support my fun fun project (Instant messaging app).

I like `NextJS 13` but in this project I am using `create-react-app`, I purposely use `create-react-app` instead of `NextJS` because: 
1. it's just for fun project, so I ignore the client/server side rendering things.
2. IMHO if we can make it in `CRA`, in `NextJS` it should be easier "with all the structure"
3. React itself is a framework for the javascript right? is that mean nextjs is a framework of a framework ? justkidding :v:
